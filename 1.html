      It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted
      by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
      languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
      web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
      web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
      originally included cues for its appearance.

      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &#60;img&#62; and
      &#60;input&#62; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such
      as &#60;p&#62; and &#60;/p&#62; surround and provide information about
      document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display
      the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
